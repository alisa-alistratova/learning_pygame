#How Video Games Work:
'''
kinda ike movies and it moves wdue to indiviudual frames
24 fps usually
you could record,draw images and use digital tools
video games work like a movie (animation)
'''
#In a movie:
# - Images are fixed.
# - No way to input stuff (except pausing and fastforwarding).

#In a video game:
# - Images are dynamically generated while the game is running.
# - Constant checking of player input to updtae what frame is being drawn.

#Creating Frames:
# 1. Checking player input.
# 2. Use that info to place elements on the screen.
# 3. Rinse and Repeat.

#What does Pygame do?:
'''
1. Pygame helps you draw images (and play sounds).
2. Checks for player input. (input() stops your code and is thus useless for games).
3. Other gamedev tools like collisions, creating text, timers, etc.
4. Nobody uses Pygame for AAA games or Indie Games.

#Game engnes:
Programmes that help you make games by giving you tools like level editors, 
physics engines, skeleton animations, etc. to make games.
